Their members are aging and the government of Japan has launched a large-scale crackdown on them to eradicate them once and for all. But who are the Yakuza? The cancer of a nation or a necessary evil in a country with one of the lowest crime rates in the industrialised world? Undoubtedly the Yakuza are involved in crimes including extortion, fraud, murder, drugs and gambling. However, Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the industrialised world, with crimes related to drugs - officially against the Yakuza code of honour - or street gangs strikingly low, a fact that many contribute to the presence of the Yakuza. Deeply rooted in Japanese society, they are seen as a necessary evil and 'problem solvers'. They have been around since the 1700s and were said to protect the weak from the strong, following a rigorous code of honour. Several clans even contributed aid for the victims of the recent earthquake and Tsunami, all reasons why the public perception of the Yakuza in Japan is not solely a negative one. Unlike the Mafia, the Yakuza is a legal, public group making them relatively easy to check on. Their offices are public, their members registered by the police and Yakuza members went as far as freely admitting their guilt in cases of crime investigations, as a part of their code of honour. In reaction to strict government measures against them, the Yakuza has ceased all cooperation with the law. As the police concentrate their resources on the Yakuza, many criminals simply don't register with clans anymore and start operating underground, evading the grasp of police. A clear trend is emerging towards a new structure of organised crime in Japan, resulting in a steep decrease in the numbers of the traditional Yakuza while the underground is soaring - including foreign Russian and Chinese mafias. This documentary deals with the struggle of the Yakuza for its survival and the restructuring of the organized crime scene in Japan. Furthermore, unprecedented access to the secret world of the Yakuza gives you an insight on who the Yakuza really are: criminals, outcasts, but also family men and a part of Japanese society.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂAnonymous",seven saints productions,0.0,1.0,2011-2020,Japan,2010.0,Documentary,JPN,Asia,japanese

We can't know yet if the discovery of life will happen in our solar system, or in another remote place in the universe, but it's clear that the next generation will witness a finding that challenges our understanding of the universe. Life forms in the most extreme conditions on Earth. Organisms can survive inside volcano craters, or adapt to the chilling temperatures of the Antarctic. Thanks to recent space missions, we can now be certain that there are other habitable planets in the solar system where life is likely to already exist. The first episode explores these findings and uncovers the future missions planned to Mars, plus Jupiter and Saturn's Moons, explaining their intentions of determining life beyond our Solar System. The second episode recaps the discoveries beyond the frontiers of our solar system. There are hundreds of billions of planetary systems similar to our relative atmosphere, size, and geological compositions to Earth. Due to super-telescopes and NASA's space satellite Kepler, we study exoplanets where life might be possible or could have been possible in the past. The Search of Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life (SETI) Institute tracks the universe in search of signals confirming the existence of intelligent life.

The welfare of the child seems assured, when all at once the oldest, ugliest and therefore forgotten fairy, appears on the scene and, furious at the slight, puts upon her, curses the baby princess and predicts that she will die poisoned by the prick of the spool of a spinning wheel. The godmother fairies, however, sooth the grief-stricken mother by telling her that her daughter will not die but only fall asleep, as well as everything living which surrounds her for one hundred years. To avoid this calamity, the king orders that every spinning wheel be destroyed under penalty of death, and the king's messenger is seen reading the command. The next scene shows the grown-up princess closely watched by a stately matron. This trusted servant, however, apparently growing too old for her task, falls asleep, and in a moment the princess is out of her apartment bound on an investigation tour. She comes to a small stairway leading to a garret and there, to her astonishment, finds an old woman spinning. Having never seen a spool, she tries to imitate the old dame, but alas, pricking her finger, falls into a dead sleep. Then is shown on the screen the whole castle in peaceful slumber, the hedges growing up and hiding the castle from view, for thus it must remain undisturbed for one hundred years. The next scene represents a young and dashing prince going out with his suite for a hunt, and one can easily detect by the difference in their attire that they belong to another epoch than that in which the charming princess lived. We follow the prince through the woods and dales until dusk, coming unawares, he finds himself lost in a thick bush. He calls for help, and an old shriveled man appears who, with one movement of his stick, causes the shrubs and trees to make way, and there appears to the eyes of the astonished rider a most beautiful castle. Pushed forward by curiosity, he rushes to the entrance, the doors opening before him as he goes along. In the chambers and halls everything is stillness and sleep, but he does not stop to think, being apparently carried along by an irresistible force, until he reaches the bedchamber of the slumbering princess. At sight of this beautiful, picture of youth, he falls on his knees, kisses the hand of the sleeper, and as by magic everything in the castle awakes and comes back to life. The last scene shows the prince and princess surrounded by their attendants and rejoicing over their good fortune.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂMoving Picture World synopsis","arte, la sept-arte, opera national de paris, telmondis, mezzo, nhk, nvc arts, saÂ¼dwestrundfunk (swr), centre national du cinema et de l'image animee (cnc), ministere de la culture et de la communication",0.0,1.0,2000 et avant,France,2000.0,"Fantastic & Sci-fi, Romance",FRA,Europe,

When she meets Lunga Sibiya, he seems to be the man she's waited her whole life for, a man who shares her values when it comes to love and relationships. Or so she thinks - Until she accidentally finds out that the man she was busy planning her forever with, had been planning his forever with someone else. After a messy breakup with Lunga, her commitment-phobic bestie, Noni, helps Dineo face what she dreads most: life as a single woman. Forced to move out of Lunga's apartment, Dineo seeks refuge with Noni. But letting go of another failed relationship is hard for Dineo. Now at her lowest point, Noni encourages Dineo to enjoy the spoils of singledom. Have fun. Meet new people. Become her own person. It's an intimidating notion for Dineo. She hasn't been single in years. But Noni is happy to be her guide. Together, they take the city night life by storm. But love is a difficult thing to avoid: Noni unexpectedly finds herself falling for an unlikely man and Dineo struggles to sidestep the traps of her romantic flaws. This is further complicated when Lunga realises the mistake he's made and declares his undying love to Dineo, wanting her back. Is Dineo strong enough to honour the new version of herself or will her fear of loneliness have her running back into Lunga's arms?ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂLwazi Mvusi",burnt onion productions,0.0,1.0,2011-2020,South Africa,2020.0,"Comedy, Romance",ZAF,Africa,english

He seems to have evoked the wrath of the Guv'nor, who lectures him about 'losing respect'. A girl called Natalie is present, and is clearly not in the Guvnor's good books. As one of the heavies removes Jacks gag, the Guvnor points a gun at his head. The scene fades to black, followed by two gunshots. The scene opens in a lively Paris bar, where the Messenger pushes his way through the vibrant crowd and into the dressing room area out back. He walks in on Girl X as she is changing. He is here to deliver a message and some flowers from Garvey, making clear that she is not pleased with Girl X fraternizing with men in the bar. To really make a point, he leaves a packet with her, which she discovers contains a ring and some teeth. Jack awakens in a bathroom in London next to the corpse of the Guvnor. Having been hit around the head, Jack is suffering from amnesia and cannot remember who he is or how he or the body got there. He searches his pockets and finds a Polaroid of a pair of breasts with the name 'Erin' and a Paris address written on the other side. Hearing police sirens, he decides to leave, figuring Paris is good place to lie low. He finds some I.D that confirms his name and address, so quickly heads there to get changes and dispose of his blood-soaked clothes. Meanwhile, the police begin investigating the Guvnor's death. They find a piece of Jack's I.D and seem to recognize him. Jack arrives in Paris and, via encounters with a talkative taxi driver and a philosophical barfly, and an attempted mugging at gunpoint; he calls at Erin's. Erin, Jack's ex-girlfriend, agrees to take him in. Back in London, the police are discussing Jack's criminal past and wondering if he's progressed to murder. The news comes through that Jack's credit card has been used in Paris. In a flashback scene, we see Jack reluctantly agreeing to help Natalie rip off the Guvnor. The next day, Jack heads out to explore Paris. He happens upon a bar, where he sees Girl X's show. Enamoured with her, he heads backstage, and interrupts the Messenger delivering another 'message' from Garvey. Jack swiftly and violently dispatches with the Messenger, taking his gun. Seeing Jack's usefulness, Girl X offers Jack payment to permanently dispose of Garvey, who is in love with her, and has been making threats against those close to her. Jack declines the offer; due to his amnesia, he is still unsure of whether he is capable of killing, and wants to keep a low profile for a while. The British police are now on their way to Paris. Natalie and her heavies are in hiding, and anonymously tip off the police information about where Jack may have headed. Semi-drunk, Jack returns to Erin's apartment, where he falls asleep in the doorway, as Erin is still at work. Erin returns, and has bought Jack a new suit. They scrub up and head out for a night on the town. Walking back along the Paris riverside, they flirt and discuss their previous relationship. Jack still cannot remember what happened, so Erin fills him in, explaining how much he hurt her. Jack wants to make it up to her. The sexual tension between them crescendos, and they head home to bed. In the morning, Jack discovers a positive pregnancy test kit in the bathroom. As it has only been a few months since they split, and Erin has been single since, he knows the child is his. As Jack heads out, Erin declares her love for him; he doesn't respond. Meanwhile, the police appear to have received some useful information. Jack mulls things over and returns, where he discovers that Erin has been brutally murdered. A bloody warning, """"""""Leave X alone"""""""" has been daubed on the wall. Narrowly escaping the police, Jack heads to see Girl X, and tells her he will deal with Garvey in exchange for the payment she offered. He takes the money and heads to a restaurant where Girl X is acting as bait to lure Garvey. Jack threatens Garvey, but is talked out of killing her due to the possibility of immediate reprisals from her henchmen. When Girl X re-enters the restaurant and sees Jack, Garvey realizes the two are colluding. They run, but Jack is struck around the head by the heavies and captured. The blow to Jacks head frees up his memories. He remembers what happened in the warehouse; Natalie killed the Guvnor, who was her father. She then knocked Jack out and dumped him next to the body to try to frame him. Jack wakes, tied to a chair in a warehouse. This time he is at the mercy of Garvey, who begins cutting chunks of flesh off Jack and eating them. She is interrupted by a call from Girl X, and leaves. Jack escapes from the warehouse by overpowering Twinkle, one of Garvey's heavies. The police have found Erin's body and are closing in on Natalie in London. Jack heads to the bar to kill Garvey, but discovers Girl X has already killed her. Girl X accidentally reveals that she killed Erin to dupe Jack into going after Garvey. Jack attacks Girl X, who staggers out to the bar and dies spectacularly on stage. Jack takes the package with his payment, which contains a picture of Serenity, Girl X's daughter. Jack realizes that this is the person she was trying to protect, and is now in danger from Garvey's men. At Garvey's restaurant, Jack kills the Messenger and rescues Serenity. Seeing a chance to try to make things right and be the father he wanted to be to Erin's unborn child, he takes Serenity with him. Just as he is about to leave Paris, the police finally catch up with him, revealing that he was deep undercover for the police, but is now quitting. He leaves with Serenity for an unknown destination.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPaul Tanter","press on features, dystopian films, kalimasu productions, lucky strike productions",0.0,1.0,2001-2010,United Kingdom,2000.0,"Thriller, Drama",GBR,Europe,english
